    <h1>Under Surveillance</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>I hope I didn't brain my damage.</h2>

      <p>Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work. Save me, Jeebus. Ahoy hoy? Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animalsâ€¦except the weasel.</p>

      <p>Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own mother just to get one! <strong>But you can't stop at one.</strong> <em>You wanna drink another woman!</em> You know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don't work out in real life, uh, Christianity.</p>

      <h2>I'm normally not a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, Superman.</h2>

      <p>Inflammable means flammable? What a country. Oh, so they have Internet on computers now! Your questions have become more redundant and annoying than the last three "Highlander" movies. Donuts. Is there anything they can't do?</p>

      <p>Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns, Boo-urns." I didn't get rich by signing checks. And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold.</p>
