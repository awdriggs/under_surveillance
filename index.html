      <h2 class="callout">You are constantly under surveillance. Just look around. </h2>
      <p>Since the 1970s, governments have increasingly used video surveillance to keep an eye on their citizenry. As the cost of video technology has gone down, the number of video surveillance devices have gone up. Private companies began installing video surveillance to protect their assets and monitor their employees. Private citizens began installing surveillance devices to protect themselves and their property. But here’s the thing:</p>
      <h2 class="callout">There is little evidence that surveillance makes us more safe.</h2>
      <p>In the United States, video surveillance is not allowed where there is a “reasonable expectation of privacy.” But reasonable by whose standards? The ubiquity of cameras has itself changed the idea of what is reasonable.</p>
      <p>Walk down any neighborhood and you will see cameras on walls, lampposts and front doors.</p>
      <p>Now with the evolution of wireless technology, these cameras are connected to servers and storage databases. Private surveillance becomes government surveillance when data is subpoenaed. Making our lives more policed than ever.</p>
      <p>This app will help you recognize surveillance in your own life.</p>
      <h2 class="callout">Open the camera to get started ↴</h2>
